1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
when creating a program specifically based on the user's preference, it is good to have user stories to tell what is liked, what is needed, and what is perferred so the user gets an easy and fun experience. Meeting up with some users that have some ideas or thoughts can provide the developing team with information that can help improve the project.


2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
While meeting up with the developing team and taking note on all the information that is provided, the project will get split up into sections or phases. Together goals will be set of what all needs to happen before the next meet untill the project is complete and reaches the clients and stakeholders expectations. If any questions come up as the project continues the Scrum Master will get the information from the Product Owner so that the Develping team has a full understanding of all the requirements and can give the clients exactly what they are looking for.

3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
